## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing NBA player performance during the 2021-2022 playoffs using advanced statistical methods and visualization techniques. The objective is to derive actionable insights that NBA teams can leverage for player evaluation, scouting, and strategic decision-making.

## Data Source and Preparation

The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from [Kaggle: NBA Player Stats](https://www.kaggle.com/). It includes detailed player statistics from the 2021-2022 NBA playoffs.

### Data Cleaning
- Player names were corrected for special characters and inconsistencies.
- Missing values in numeric columns were handled using median imputation.
- An **Assist-to-Turnover (AST/TO) ratio** was calculated to provide additional insight into player efficiency.

## Methodology and Key Insights

### 1. Correlation Analysis
A correlation matrix was used to explore relationships between key statistics, such as points, assists, rebounds, blocks, and steals, as well as shooting percentages. This helps identify the strongest associations between stats and overall player performance.

### 2. Top Player Analysis by Categories
The top 5 players in each statistical category (Points, Assists, Rebounds, Blocks, Steals) were identified. Tie-breakers such as games played, shooting percentages, and minutes played were used to rank players when necessary.

### 3. Weighted Overall Player Score
An overall performance score was calculated using a weighted system based on key statistics. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to observe the impact of changing the weights on player rankings. The top overall performers include **Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Dončić, Jimmy Butler, Jayson Tatum,** and **Stephen Curry**.

### 4. Predictive Modeling (Linear Regression and Random Forest)
Predictive models were built to forecast player performance, focusing on points per game (PTS). The models were evaluated based on RMSE, MAE, and R-squared (R²) values, with the **Random Forest model** showing superior performance.

### 5. Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Players were categorized into **Elite Players, Key Players, and Role Players** using K-means clustering. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to visualize these clusters, providing a clear picture of player tiers based on performance metrics.

### 6. Comparative Analysis
A comparison between **Luka Dončić** and **Giannis Antetokounmpo** was conducted using both radar charts and bar plots. This comparison highlights the distinct playstyles of the two players, with **Giannis** excelling in rebounds and blocks, and **Luka** dominating in assists.

### 7. Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis was performed to explore how different weightings in the overall scoring system affected player rankings. This analysis demonstrates the importance of weighting certain metrics when evaluating player performance.

## Visualizations

- **Top 5 Players by Category**: Bar charts for points, assists, rebounds, blocks, and steals.
- **Top 5 Weighted Overall Players**: Bar chart representing the top 5 overall players based on the weighted scoring system.
- **K-Means Clustering in PCA Space**: A scatter plot showing how players are categorized into clusters (Elite, Key, Role Players) based on performance metrics.
- **Luka Dončić vs. Giannis Antetokounmpo Comparison**: Radar and bar charts comparing the two star players across key metrics.
- **Correlation Matrix**: A heatmap of correlations between key statistics like points, assists, and shooting percentages.
- **Actual vs. Predicted Points**: Scatter plot showing predicted vs. actual points scored by players.
- **Cross-Validation RMSE vs. Number of Predictors**: Line chart demonstrating how model performance changes as predictors are added.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Plot comparing original and alternate weightings in the overall player rankings.

## Conclusion

The analysis successfully identified key players and provided deep insights into their performance during the 2021-2022 NBA playoffs. The **weighted scoring system** highlighted the top-performing players overall, while **regression** and **random forest models** provided predictive insights. **Clustering and PCA** helped categorize players based on performance, and the comparison between Luka Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo showcased the differences in their playing styles.

## Future Work

1. **Advanced Metrics**: Future analysis could include metrics like Player Efficiency Rating (PER) and Win Shares (WS) to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of player performance.
2. **Team-Level Analysis**: Expanding the analysis to team performance and contributions.
3. **Predictive Analytics**: Implementing time-series forecasting models to predict player performance for future seasons.
